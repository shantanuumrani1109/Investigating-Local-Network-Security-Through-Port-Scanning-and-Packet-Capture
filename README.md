# Investigating Local Network Security Through Port Scanning and Packet Capture

**Description:**
This project evaluates local network security using Nmap and Wireshark by identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. It performs device discovery, TCP SYN scans, and analyzes ARP/SYN packets to detect risks, map services, study traffic, and strengthen network defenses.

All IP addresses are sanitized (last octet masked) and all MAC addresses removed for privacy.
