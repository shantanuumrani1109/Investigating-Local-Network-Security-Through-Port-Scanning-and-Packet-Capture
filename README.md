# Investigating-Local-Network-Security-Through-Port-Scanning-and-Packet-Capture
This project evaluates local network security using port scanning and packet capture to identify open ports, active services, and vulnerabilities. With Nmap, Wireshark, and TCPDump, it analyzes traffic, detects suspicious activity, and demonstrates best practices for stronger network defense.
